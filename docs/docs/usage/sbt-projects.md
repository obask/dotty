title: "Using Dotty with sbt"
---

It is now possible to use Dotty with sbt thanks to the dotty-bridge project.
There are two alternatives in how to create an sbt project that uses dotty:

* [dotty-example-project](https://github.com/smarter/dotty-example-project)
  for a simple sbt project that compiles code with Dotty
* [sbt-dotty](https://github.com/felixmulder/sbt-dotty) an sbt plugin that
  takes care of all dependencies and settings needed to get a Dotty sbt project
